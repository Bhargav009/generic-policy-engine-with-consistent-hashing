Current project includes a Proof of concept for a generic scalable policy engine.
Policy engine is based on drools with rule kjars discovery in a remote maven repository. 
Messages are delivered at the policy engine workers based on consistent hashing technique.

Prerequisites:
1. Rabbitmq pub/sub framework with the https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-consistent-hash-exchange enabled.
You can access to http://localhost:15672 with username/password guest/guest.
You should configure rabbitmq by ip at the application properties of policyengine
docker-compose up -d broker
docker exec broker rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
docker exec broker rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_consistent_hash_exchange
2. A Nexus maven repository
docker-compose up -d my-nexus //like this there is a connectivity problem between policy manager container and nexus
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 -p 8082:8082 -p 8083:8083 --name my-nexus sonatype/nexus3:3.0.0
create maven-group repository including sub repositories  with central-releases-snapshots
Extra information can be found http://codeheaven.io/using-nexus-3-as-your-repository-part-1-maven-artifacts/
You can access Nexus repository at http://localhost:8081


Local mode execution it in standalone mode:
mvn clean instal 
java -jar target/consistent-hash-exchange-policy-engine-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 

Containerized mode:
Extra prerequisites:
3. Traefik load balancer 
Stop apache because traefik uses the port 80 : 
sudo service apache2 stop
docker-compose up -d reverse-proxy 
You can access traefik at http://localhost:8080/dashboard/


// create image for policyengine
docker  build -t consistentpolicyengine .
Create only one worker:
docker-compose up -d consistentpolicyengine
Create a cluster of policy engine containers:
docker-compose up -d --scale consistentpolicyengine=2 

usefull commmands for testing:
docker images
To remove all images which are not used by existing containers, use the -a flag:
docker image prune -a
Kill all policy engine workers:
docker rm $(docker stop $(docker ps -a -q --filter ancestor=consistentpolicyengine --format="{{.ID}}"))
